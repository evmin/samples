## User story

### Hello AI World overview

L100 level aplication stub for an AI copilot/agent.

## Getting Started

### Codespaces and DevContainers

This respository has been configured to support GitHub Codespace and DevContainers.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/dbroeglin/hello-ai-world) [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/dbroeglin/hello-ai-world)

### Local

It is possible to operate the fully local setup.

  - [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli): `az`
  - [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview): `azd`
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/): `python`
  - [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/): `uv`
  - Optionally [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/): `docker` 

> [!TIP] 
> **AI GBB Tip**: Document here how to quickly deploy the solution. Try to reduce this to `azd up` by
> automating as much as possible. Have a look at `main.bicep` and `scripts` for examples of how to do
> that

### Quick deploy

To deploy Hello AI World just run: 
`azd up`

> **WARNING** The application automatically configures authentication to secure frontend
> To do so it creates an app registration in EntraID. 
> If the account you are using to deploy the app does not have the required permissions, disable the preprovision script in azure.yaml

## How it works

### User Manual

- TODO : Obervability
> [!TIP] 
> **AI GBB Tip**: Document how the solution is used and operated here.
> Optionally, if the section is too long, create a `USER_MANUAL.md` file and
> link to it from here.
